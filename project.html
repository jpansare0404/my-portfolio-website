                which
                is
                intended to assist new users in efficiently comprehending its features. The app is specifically

                to
                aid users in locating cost-effective security systems, connecting with experts for guidance, and

                I conducted thorough research, conceived innovative designs, and created an
                application that empowers
                users
                by
                providing education and awareness on the home security market. This initiative is dedicated
                to
                enhancing
                the
                safety
                and well-being of communities and was undertaken as part of my UX Design course at CareerFoundry.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <section>Homeowners require an intuitive solution for self-selecting and 
            installing home security systems, eliminating the need for 
            professional help. This product offers direct expert guidance 
            through video calls for DIY home security solutions and real-time 
            neighborhood crime updates.
            
            Effectiveness will be assessed via metrics like user adoption, 
            positive feedback, and improved DIY security product experiences.

<h3>solution</h3>
<p>The primary focus of this research is to evaluate the userfriendliness of a mobile application developed to assist newcomers 
    in locating affordable security systems. Moreover, the application 
    facilitates connections with experts for guidance and offers realtime updates on local criminal activities.</p>
    <h3>Interview & Surveys</h3>
    <p>In conducting user interviews and surveys, my objective was to gain 
        insight into the preferences and values associated with this app 
        category. I enlisted the participation of four users and, with their consent, 
        recorded these sessions to facilitate quote and observation analysis. I 
        utilized an affinity map to categorize behaviors, attitudes, needs, goals, 
        frustrations, and quotes for better organization and comprehension.</p>
        <a><img src="./img/diy-expert/research-goal.png" alt=""></a>
</section>
<p>I developed two distinct personas representing individuals with different motivations for using the app. Crafting these personas played a crucial role in guiding the 
    design process, ensuring that the features catered to their specific needs. With the personas in place, I then created a journey map to visualize the unique 
    experiences each persona would encounter while attempting to accomplish various tasks. This approach provided valuable insights into their interactions with the 
    app.</p></div>

<h3>After defining the user personas, I moved on to creating User Flows, a valuable tool that outlines the step-by-step processes these
     individuals will undertake while navigating and completing tasks within the DIY EXPERT app.</h3>
